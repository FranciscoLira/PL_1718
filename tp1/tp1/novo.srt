320
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:40,861
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.

307
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,989
Forty-six percent of you I could link to a business,

287
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,474
So I ran a little scan.

321
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,087
So something for you to think about:

308
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,177
XYZ Employee network.

288
00:14:57,474 --> 00:15:00,723
I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,

322
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:47,432
As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,

309
00:15:59,177 --> 00:16:03,818
This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.

289
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:03,549
who wouldn't be so concerned by law,

323
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:50,006
as we play with these shiny new toys,

324
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:54,250
how much are we trading off convenience

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,056
things start to happen on the computer on their own,

325
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,460
for privacy and security?

111
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,205
usually a bad sign.

326
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,746
Next time you install something,

112
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:07,086
This would, of course, normally happen

340
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:50,956
In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,

327
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:02,304
look at the settings and ask yourself,

113
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:10,149
in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,

341
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:55,148
and there are similar statistics all over the world.

328
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:06,249
"Is this information that I want to share?

114
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,992
but I've kind of slowed it down

342
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:59,675
We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.

329
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:09,459
Would someone be able to abuse it?"

115
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:15,135
so you can actually see the attack occurring.

343
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,371
The cybercriminals I talked about,

116
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:17,931
Malware is very boring otherwise.

344
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,746
despite theft of millions of dollars,

130
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:58,853
the attackers can get with such a simple operation?

117
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,815
So this is writing out the malicious code,

345
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,088
actually still haven't been arrested,

131
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,998
Let me show you how most malware

118
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:25,032
and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,

346
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:10,041
and at this point possibly never will.

132
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:03,422
is now distributed today.

119
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:29,805
you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.

360
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:01,122
find these simple best practices,

347
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,928
Most laws are national in their implementation,

133
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,221
What I'm going to do is open up a website

361
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,958
find out how to update and patch your computer.

348
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:18,369
despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet

134
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:07,682
that I wrote.

362
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,681
Get a secure password.

349
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:21,819
is borderless and international by definition.

135
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:12,475
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.

363
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,380
Make sure you use a different password

136
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,911
And it's got a comments section here

364
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,102
on each of your sites and services online.

150
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:55,268
I'm going to open up the web browser

137
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:18,999
where we can submit comments to the website.

365
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:14,703
Find these resources. Apply them.

151
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,770
and browse to my website,

138
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:22,339
Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.

366
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:17,603
The Internet is a fantastic resource

152
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,978
www.incrediblyhacked.com.

139
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,501
Unfortunately, when this was implemented,

367
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,896
for business, for political expression,

153
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,337
Notice that after a couple of seconds,

368
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:22,485
for art and for learning.

154
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:05,955
I get redirected.

369
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:26,019
Help me and the security community

155
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:08,150
That website address at the top there,

156
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,850
which you can just about see, microshaft.com,

170
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,772
Now I liked it better when viruses were free.

157
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,396
the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,

171
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:59,858
(Laughter)

158
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:19,865
and up pops fake antivirus.

172
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,663
People now pay cybercriminals money

159
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:25,480
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,

173
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,997
to run viruses,

174
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:08,063
which I find utterly bizarre.

10
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:03,101
in malware and hacking looks like.

175
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,990
So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.

11
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:06,892
So today, computer viruses and trojans,

176
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,884
Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day

12
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:10,091
designed to do everything from stealing data

210
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,092
An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones

190
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,013
like many of you might use.

177
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:17,722
is a massive challenge,

13
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,358
to watching you in your webcam

211
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,943
is that when you take a photo,

191
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,780
At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.

178
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,020
and those numbers are only growing

14
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:15,443
to the theft of billions of dollars.

212
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:59,648
it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.

192
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,077
What this would do is send the cybercriminals

179
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,328
directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.

15
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,881
Some malicious code today goes as far

213
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:02,362
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time

193
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:08,674
a text message every day telling them how much money

16
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:22,482
as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.

214
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,854
on Internet dating sites recently,

194
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,524
they'd made that day,

30
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:11,959
are small business websites getting infected.

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,660
Let me give you a quick snapshot

215
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:07,531
obviously for research purposes,

195
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:14,185
so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.

31
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,497
Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like?

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,563
of what malicious code is capable of today.

216
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:11,442
and I've noticed that about 60 percent

196
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,246
If you look closely, you'll notice a series

32
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:17,191
Well, many of you have the image, don't you,

19
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:30,972
Right now, every second, eight new users

230
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:56,233
for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,

217
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,577
of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites

197
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:20,559
of what are Russian telephone numbers.

33
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,608
of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,

231
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:02,172
on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.

218
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:19,520
contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,

198
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,202
Now that's obviously interesting,

34
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:22,260
hacking away for notoriety.

232
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,615
One of these was more stereotypical for me.

219
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,698
which is kind of scary

199
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:25,797
because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,062
But actually today, cybercriminals

233
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:10,045
A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.

36
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:27,739
are wonderfully professional and organized.

234
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:13,983
Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals

50
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:04,017
Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term

37
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,928
In fact, they have product adverts.

235
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,058
sharing information scarcely.

51
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,632
DDOS service or scheduled attack,

38
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:33,295
You can go online and buy a hacking service

236
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:17,333
Imagine what you could find

52
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:10,864
starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites

39
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:35,681
to knock your business competitor offline.

250
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:03,552
can break our security even when we do the right things.

237
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,224
about each of the people in this room.

53
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:14,090
to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.

251
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:06,639
This is MobSoft, one of the companies

238
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,230
A bit more searching through the profile

54
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,559
James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay

252
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,044
that this cybercriminal gang owned,

239
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,295
and there's a photo of their office.

55
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:18,661
one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.

1
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,104
I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'

253
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:10,809
and an interesting thing about MobSoft

56
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:22,541
Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.

2
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,838
latest and nastiest creations.

254
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,998
is the 50-percent owner of this

70
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,839
This is the market leader in malware distribution,

57
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,445
Turns out that's not cool.

3
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:44,068
So basically, please don't go and download

255
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:16,160
posted a job advert,

71
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,659
the Black Hole Exploit Pack,

58
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:27,787
But regardless, it's amazing how many products

4
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:47,062
any of the viruses that I show you.

256
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,914
and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers

72
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,722
responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution

59
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:31,244
and services are available now to cybercriminals.

5
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:50,414
Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,

270
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,075
Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.

257
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:22,304
from the code earlier.

73
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:08,914
in the last couple of quarters.

271
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:03,336
Let me come back to that in just a minute.

258
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,664
This woman was Maria,

74
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:12,256
It comes with technical installation guides,

6
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:52,823
and I thought I'd give you a quick insight

272
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:06,387
I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,

259
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:27,862
and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.

75
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:13,417
video setup routines,

7
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:55,797
into my career so far.

273
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,795
a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,

76
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:17,809
and get this, technical support.

8
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,574
It's a pretty accurate description.

274
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:14,199
but is interesting in exposing how much information

90
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,977
that says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,

77
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,461
You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you

9
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:00,413
This is what someone that specializes

275
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,171
we're all giving away,

91
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:05,047
and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars

78
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:24,484
how to set up your illegal hacking server.

276
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:20,922
and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.

92
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:07,742
because I like your face."

79
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:29,241
So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.

310
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:08,781
Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,

290
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,422
and here you can see my mobile device.

277
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,643
This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets

93
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:11,511
Or funnycats.exe, which rumor has it

311
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:13,044
absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.

291
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,369
Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.

278
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:28,328
trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.

94
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,697
was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.

312
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:17,429
Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.

292
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:14,508
TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?

279
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,200
Many of you all know about the concept

95
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:18,396
Now there are many ways you can get infected.

313
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,004
Your wireless network name is so unique

293
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:18,387
My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,

96
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:20,602
I want to show you a couple of my favorites.

314
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,725
that I was able to pinpoint it

294
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,347
which I think is a great name.

100
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,686
Awww.

97
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:23,557
This is a little USB key.

315
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,687
using data available openly on the Internet

295
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:23,420
Sophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.

101
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:35,310
Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.

98
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,952
Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?

316
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:29,404
with no hacking or clever, clever tricks.

296
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,094
Loganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.

102
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,962
So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,

99
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:30,533
Well, you could try looking really cute.

330
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,760
We also need to think very carefully

317
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,426
And I should mention as well that

297
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,805
CIASurveillanceVan.

103
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:43,118
looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.

331
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,359
about how we develop our future talent pool.

318
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:33,138
some of you do use your names,

298
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,592
We called it that at one of our conferences

104
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,227
which I've covered in coffee,

332
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,667
You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,

319
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:36,021
"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.

299
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:33,520
because we thought that would freak people out,

105
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:48,989
and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key

333
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:23,194
and that 250,000 pieces of malware

106
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:51,153
and print me a new one.

334
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:26,384
won't stay the same for long.

120
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:31,950
Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,

107
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:54,741
So let's have a look here on my victim computer.

335
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,825
There's a very concerning trend

121
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,512
this is what we call a command prompt,

108
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:58,346
What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.

336
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:32,371
that whilst many people coming out of schools now

122
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:38,729
and using this we can navigate around the computer.

109
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:00,000
After a couple of seconds,

350
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,965
Countries do not agree, which makes this area

337
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:37,271
are much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,

123
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,126
We can access your documents, your data.

351
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,982
exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.

338
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:41,283
fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects

124
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,793
You can turn on the webcam.

352
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:33,824
But my biggest ask is this:

339
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:46,086
to know how that technology works under the covers.

125
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,602
That can be very embarrassing.

353
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:35,648
You see, you're going to leave here

126
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,516
Or just to really prove a point,

354
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:39,776
and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.

140
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,194
the developer was slightly inebriated

127
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:49,982
we can launch programs like my personal favorite,

355
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,190
You're going to read about malware doing incredible

141
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,574
and managed to forget

128
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:53,097
the Windows Calculator.

356
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,812
and terrifying, scary things.

142
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,893
all of the secure coding practices he had learned.

129
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,638
So isn't it amazing how much control

370
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,871
make life much, much more difficult

357
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:50,175
However, 99 percent of it works

143
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:35,298
So let's imagine that our attacker,

371
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:32,038
for cybercriminals.

358
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:54,828
because people fail to do the basics.

144
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:39,127
called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,

372
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,513
Thank you.

359
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:58,185
So my ask is this: Go online,

145
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,374
inserts something a little nasty.

373
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:38,554
(Applause)

146
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,261
This is a script.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,106
and it will go through and it will scan the system,

147
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:47,789
It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.

161
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,781
have a look at what its popping up here.

148
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,371
So I'm going to submit this post,

162
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,722
It creates some very serious alerts.

149
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:53,016
and then, on my victim computer,

163
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:34,324
Oh look, a child porn proxy server.

164
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:37,025
We really should clean that up.

165
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,785
What's really insulting about this is

166
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:43,491
not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,

200
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:28,146
Down below, highlighted in red,

180
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,412
So I want to talk to you briefly

167
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,626
but when the scan finishes, they tell you

201
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:30,090
in the other section of source code,

181
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:29,799
about a group of hackers we tracked for a year

168
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,095
in order to clean up the fake viruses,

202
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,137
is this bit "leded:leded."

182
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,028
and actually found --

169
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:53,067
you have to register the product.

203
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:34,568
That's a username,

183
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:34,890
and this is a rare treat in our job.

204
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,743
kind of like you might have on Twitter.

184
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,648
Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,

20
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:33,365
are joining the Internet.

205
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,110
So let's take this a little further.

185
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:40,301
people from Facebook, independent researchers,

21
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:41,482
Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.

206
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,618
There are a few other interesting pieces

186
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,612
guys from Sophos.

22
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:47,893
We will see 30,000 new infected websites.

220
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:23,544
because you wouldn't give out your home address

207
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:44,145
the cybercriminals had uploaded.

187
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:45,560
So here we have a couple of documents

23
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:50,210
And, just to kind of tear down a myth here,

221
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,153
to lots of strangers,

208
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,001
Lots of you here will use smartphones

188
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,699
which our cybercriminals had uploaded

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,973
lots of people think that when you get infected

222
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:27,367
but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates

209
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,941
to take photos and post them from the conference.

189
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,560
to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,

25
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:56,805
with a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.

223
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:31,842
to plus or minus 15 meters.

26
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:59,518
Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking,

224
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:35,434
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.

40
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,413
Check out this one I found.

27
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:02,989
if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.

225
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:38,992
So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.

41
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:39,433
(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,

28
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,323
People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)

226
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:43,086
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.

42
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,060
and that reason is

29
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:08,058
Actually, about 80 percent of these

240
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,570
They were working on the third floor.

227
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:45,745
We used Google.

43
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,183
because you need your business competitors,

241
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,012
And you can also see some photos

228
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:48,216
Using the email address, the telephone number

44
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:47,572
rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,

242
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,317
from his business companion

229
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:52,158
and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert

45
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:49,509
they are to go down.

243
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:34,691
where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.

46
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:52,685
Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.

244
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:39,128
It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.

60
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,993
For example, this testing platform,

47
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,368
If you want your business competitors to go down,

245
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:42,478
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.

61
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:35,898
which enables the cybercriminals

48
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,852
well, they can.

246
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:46,857
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.

62
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:38,654
to test the quality of their viruses

49
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:00,655
If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.

260
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:31,771
And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings

247
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,117
And herein is the greatest lesson

63
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,378
before they release them on the world.

261
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,876
and clicked on every option imaginable

248
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:54,202
of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.

64
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:43,551
For a small fee, they can upload it

262
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:38,981
to make herself really, really insecure.

249
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:58,344
Our friends, our families and our colleagues

65
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,401
and make sure everything is good.

263
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:40,722
By the end of the investigation,

66
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,104
But it goes further.

264
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:44,674
where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,

80
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,809
What I've got here is two systems,

67
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,597
Cybercriminals now have crime packs

265
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,933
we had photos of the cybercriminals,

81
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:35,907
an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,

68
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,061
with business intelligence reporting dashboards

266
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:50,148
even the office Christmas party

82
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:39,574
and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.

69
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:56,921
to manage the distribution of their malicious code.

300
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,734
which is quite fun.

280
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,802
of scanning for wireless networks.

267
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,221
when they were out on an outing.

83
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:42,605
Now normally, these would be on different sides

301
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:40,908
This is how geeks party.

281
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:36,579
You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry

268
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,829
That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,

84
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,443
of the planet or of the Internet,

302
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,359
So let's make this a little bit more interesting.

282
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,044
and connect to something like TEDAttendees.

269
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,592
as it turns out.

85
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:46,993
but I've put them side by side

303
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,177
Let's talk about you.

283
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,984
But what you might not know

86
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:49,952
because it makes things much more interesting.

304
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,521
Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks

284
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:48,260
is that you're also beaming out a list of networks

87
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:52,234
Now, there are many ways you can get infected.

305
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,980
recently and used the wireless network.

285
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,950
you've previously connected to,

88
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:55,112
You will have come in contact with some of them.

306
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,273
Things get more interesting.

286
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,556
even when you're not using wireless actively.

89
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:57,440
Maybe some of you have received an email
